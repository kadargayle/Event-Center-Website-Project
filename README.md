# Event-Center-Website-Project
It’s time to bring everything together! You’ll combine all your previous HTML and CSS skills to build a multi-page Event Center Website that showcases events, schedules, and venue information.


In this project, you will design and build a multi-page Event Center website that showcases your event offerings, schedule, and venue details. This is your opportunity to bring a real-world scenario to life using everything you’ve learned so far—semantic HTML, layout design, forms, responsive styling, and interactivity.

Here’s the fun part: you get to choose the theme or type of event center! 🎉 Whether it’s a wedding venue, concert hall, conference center, or a festival arena, this is your chance to pick your favorite scenario and design a website that reflects that choice. Think of it as simulating a real event center—how would you present it online? What features and visuals would make it appealing to potential clients or visitors?

This project is your moment to be creative and strategic:

Organize pages logically (Home, About, Events, Booking, Contact, etc.)
Highlight your offerings with interactive and engaging sections
Use forms, schedules, and visuals to make your website functional and user-friendly
Apply your own design style to create a polished, professional result
By the end, you’ll have a portfolio-worthy website that demonstrates both your technical skills and your ability to design for a real-world client scenario.

💡 Requirements
🏗️ HTML Structure
Your website should include at least three pages, such as:

index.html — Home page (introduction to the event center and featured events)

Links (internal, external, and anchor links)
A contact form with text inputs, email input, textarea, and a submit button for inquiries or bookings
A footer with social media links or copyright information
